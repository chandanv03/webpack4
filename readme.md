# Webpack 4 Template for React, or anything else

Features :
* SCSS Compiler
* Babel (ES6)
* React

I've also included the i8n plugin I use a lot for internationalization, i18n-next I've found to be really useful at adding multiple language support to an app. 

Along with that formik (good library for signup forms), lodash & moment, react-helmet for adding meta tags on-the-fly to the page and superagent for ajax requests.

Feel free to fork and customize it to your needs, I'll endeavour to keep this as up-to-date as possible while I'm working on other projects.

If you see an error or something that could be improved, log an issue and I'll check it out or if you just need a hand getting it to run.

Very Best,



John Griffiths
